# 🐦 Bird Species Observation Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the distribution, diversity, and behavior of bird species across multiple habitats, focusing on **forests** and **grasslands**.  
Using **Power BI**, the dashboard provides spatial, temporal, and environmental insights, enabling data-driven decision-making for **biodiversity conservation**, **eco-tourism planning**, and **policy support**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify biodiversity hotspots and high-risk habitats.
- Understand seasonal and temporal trends in bird activity.
- Assess the impact of environmental factors on species observations.
- Highlight conservation priorities using **Watchlist species** data.
- Forecast future bird observations for proactive planning.
